I am a passionate software engineer focused on building cloud-based solutions that empower businesses, address technical challenges, and deliver innovative, intelligent applications. My goal is to develop systems that are bigger, faster, more efficient, and automated, enabling companies to grow and better serve their customers.

Beginning my career as a PHP back-end developer in 2015, I have expanded my expertise to become a full-stack software developer, managing back-end and front-end development, databases, shared and cloud servers, email servers, on-page SEO, digital analytics, API development, and integrations.

With experience working with over 20 clients and companies on more than 50 public and private projects across the past decade—including sectors like healthcare, technology, e-commerce, hospitality, logistics, grooming, coaching and education, manufacturing, travel, customer support, and startups—I specialize in identifying business challenges and crafting technical solutions that minimize manual effort and maximize the effective use of technology.
