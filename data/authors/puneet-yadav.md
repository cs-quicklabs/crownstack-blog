Experienced QA Automation Lead with a strong foundation in building scalable, efficient, and maintainable automation frameworks. My expertise spans across tools and technologies like Playwright, Katalon Studio, Rainforest QA, Jenkins, JMeter, and programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java.

Passionate about software quality, CI/CD pipelines, performance testing, and staying at the cutting edge of technology, I enjoy taking ownership of complex challenges and delivering robust solutions. I thrive in environments that value precision, performance, and continuous improvement.

I am always eager to learn new tools, explore modern tech stacks, and take initiative in adopting innovations that improve productivity and quality. I believe challenges are key to personal and professional growth and actively seek out opportunities that push me beyond my comfort zone.

When not working, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and law, delving into cybersecurity, and sharing knowledge with peers.
