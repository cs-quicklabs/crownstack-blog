I am an enthusiastic software engineer who aims to create software solutions on cloud that empower businesses, help solve technical challenges faced by the companies and bring innovative and smart solutions in the applications. I am always looking to make bigger, faster, easier and automated systems for companies to help their businesses grow and serve their customers better.

Started as back-end developer in PHP in 2014, I gradually learnt new skills to become a full-stack software developer managing Back-End, Front-End, Databases, Shared, Cloud & Email Servers, On-Page SEO, Digital Analytics, APIs Development & Integrations.
