# Why we made these guidelines?

Crownstack collaborates with third-party vendor resources as needed, typically with prior customer consent, when deploying resources to client projects. In most cases, we are obligated to serve our customers in accordance with our contractual agreements. To maintain quality control and provide clear guidance to third-party resources, we have established a set of guidelines. These ensure compliance with our commitments and help new resources understand their roles, responsibilities, and best practices from the outset.

# Crownstack guidelines for vendor resources to follow

## General & HR guidelines

1. You have been granted access to **QuickTeams**, Crownstack's internal project and resource management tool. As part of our standard process, we request you to regularly update your timesheets with details of your daily work progress against the assigned project. The HR team will provide a walkthrough session to guide you through the process. If you encounter any difficulties or require any clarifications, please feel free to reach out to them for assistance.
2. Please mention your daily login and logout time in the **‘TASK’** description when responding to QuickTeams emails. Our HR team will provide further details on this via call or email.
3. You are required to follow **Crownstack's holiday calendar** as per the agreement with the client. Our HR team will share the holiday calendar with you via email.
4. To ensure a smooth leave application process and help us manage the project and resources effectively, the following Leave protocol is established:
    1. When planning leaves, kindly submit your request well in advance:
        1. For a shorter leave duration (1-3 days), approval is needed at least 15 days before departure.
        2. For longer leave duration (more than 3 days) approval should be taken at least a month in advance.
        3. Please inform us in Crownstack about your intended leave before contacting the client. Once we've discussed it internally, we can proceed or guide you through the necessary steps for client communication.
        4. In case of any emergencies, separate leave notifications should be sent to Crownstack and the client (Copying Crownstack’s Delivery Team).
5. Crownstack expects you to focus solely on the project assigned by us. Any indication of involvement in unauthorized projects will be reported to your company immediately. Additionally, if we find any breach of mutual trust at the organizational level, we may reconsider our engagement and discontinue services immediately.

## Immediate steps to perform after on-boarding

1. After your onboarding, we expect you to set up the project repositories on your laptop on your first day itself. Timely project setup is crucial, and any delays are not anticipated.
2. Please reach out to your client or your project lead at Crownstack to obtain the necessary access required for project setup.
3. While setting up the project, you may encounter errors that could block the installation process. We recommend not spending excessive time resolving them on your own. If an issue persists after 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, promptly inform your project lead at Crownstack. If the issue cannot be resolved immediately, we will guide you on the next steps to follow.
4. Be highly vigilant with your daily tasks assigned by the client. Any delays at the start can be challenging to recover later, so staying proactive and on schedule is crucial.

## Guidelines that ensures doing daily work smoothly

1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and a quiet, distraction-free workspace. When attending meetings, use a good-quality microphone and headphones for clear communication.
2. Ensure your camera is turned ON during all meetings, including both client and Crownstack meetings.
3. Join all meetings on time, especially client stand-up calls. If you anticipate any delays or unavailability due to an emergency, please inform both the client and your project lead at Crownstack in advance.
4. Before sharing your screen in a meeting, please close all irrelevant or personal browser tabs and applications to maintain professionalism and avoid distractions.
5. Stay active on Slack/Teams during your work hours. If you step away for a break, lunch, or any other reason, update your status to "Away," "Lunch," "Break," or a suitable status to keep your team informed.
6. Sync your Crownstack and client-provided email accounts on your mobile. Additionally, install Slack, Teams, or any other communication tools used by Crownstack and your project. This ensures better availability, even when you are away from your laptop.
7. Avoid 1:1 chats with anyone, whether on Crownstack or the client side, or use them sparingly. Always communicate in groups or channels where your team is a member. This ensures transparency, keeps everyone in the loop, and helps streamline progress updates and team synchronization.
8. Ensure that the chat group you use for communication includes all relevant project stakeholders. Avoid using developer-only channels for project-related discussions, as the client should always have visibility into the progress and ongoing conversations.
9. (Optional – varies by project) Before submitting your pull request (PR) for client review, first share it with your project lead at Crownstack. The Crownstack team will conduct an initial code review, and only after approval should you forward the PR to the client. As we gain confidence in your code quality, the frequency of internal reviews may be adjusted based on feedback from your project lead.
10. You are expected to share your daily progress with both your client team (via Slack, Teams, etc.) and the Crownstack team (on Slack) before ending your workday. This is mandatory—please do not skip it on any day.

Adhering to these protocols ensures efficient resource management and helps us plan effectively. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out.
