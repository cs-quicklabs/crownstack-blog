There are times when you want to run multiple PHP versions in your system, maybe because you are working on multiple projects that requires different PHP versions, or your operating system installs the PHP version provided by the official PPA repositories of your system. Let's see how we can install and run multiple PHP versions in the same system.

## Step 1: Adding PHP's PPA in the system

Adding `ondrej/php` in your system allows providing more up-to-date information of the latest PHP versions available to install:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

After adding the PPA, update the repositories of your system:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
```

## Step 2: Installed the required PHP version and it's libraries

You can now install required PHP along with PHP libraries of same version. Example:

```bash
sudo apt install php7.0 php7.0-fpm php7.0-mysql
```

or

```bash
sudo apt install php8.1 php8.1-fpm php8.1-mysql
```

## Step 3: Activate desired PHP version on CLI

If you wish to use PHP on CLI, you can list and activate your desired PHP version.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```

This command shows all the installed and currently active PHP version. You can select the PHP version you want to activate on CLI by supplying the suitable Selection number:
