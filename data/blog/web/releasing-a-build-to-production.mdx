Releasing a build to production is a critical process that requires careful planning, coordination, and execution. It involves multiple phases and stakeholders ‚Äî from initial infrastructure setup to post-release monitoring. This updated blog blends the best practices from the original process with an actionable four-part checklist for improved transparency, reduced risk, and reliable user experience.

## ONE-TIME SETUP

These steps ensure your infrastructure and credentials are aligned well before the release window begins.

1. **Initial server setup initiated with the client**  
   Contact the client early in the project to initiate the server setup process. This includes provisioning environments and aligning expectations around infrastructure and access.

2. **Finalize hosting details with the client**  
   Understand where the application will be hosted. If undecided, recommend AWS or a similar reliable service. Help the client create an account if needed and ensure access credentials are available for the setup team.

3. **Receive domain and SSL certificates (Web only)**  
   Confirm with the client whether they have a domain and SSL. If yes, get access. If no, guide them through acquiring one and configuring DNS settings for production.

4. **Share and walk through mobile metadata (Mobile only)**  
   Share app metadata sheets with the client. Walk them through fields like app name, description, category, and Apple developer rules (e.g., company name cannot be changed later).

5. **Production setup must use the client‚Äôs account**  
   Ensure that no production component ‚Äî servers, databases, or CI/CD tools ‚Äî runs on agency/personal credentials. All should be provisioned under the client‚Äôs account or organization.

6. **Check infrastructure readiness**  
   Validate the complete setup:
   - Servers and data configured
   - Domain and subdomain live
   - SSL implemented
   - Third-party services (mailing, caching, analytics) connected and working

## üß™ PRE-DEPLOYMENT

With development complete, ensure the product is stable, tested, and safe for release.

1. **Code freeze and final testing**  
   Initiate code freeze to lock all changes. Conduct complete testing:

   - **Unit Testing:** Each function/component tested in isolation
   - **Integration Testing:** Modules interact correctly
   - **Regression Testing:** Past bugs don‚Äôt resurface
   - **Performance Testing:** No bottlenecks under load
   - **Security Testing:** Scan for vulnerabilities or insecure dependencies

2. **Code review and approval**  
   Ensure that all PRs are reviewed for business logic, performance, and security. Get formal approvals from the TL/PM before proceeding.

3. **Environment verification and deployment readiness**

   - Ensure production mirrors staging.
   - Validate environment variables and secrets.
   - Confirm `.env` files, tokens, and endpoints are all updated for production.
   - Ensure third-party services use production credentials.

4. **Infrastructure and rollback plan confirmed**

   - Ensure servers are stable and databases backed up.
   - Prepare a tested rollback plan, especially if the release involves schema or service changes.

5. **Database migration and tagging**

   - Confirm if DB schema has changed. Prepare data migration files.
   - Take DB backup.
   - Create semantic version Git tags (e.g., v1.0.2) and generate GitHub releases.

6. **Client approval and downtime plan (Web)**  
   Notify the client in writing (email/Slack) and get approval. Publish a downtime notice or maintenance page to prepare end users.

7. **Staging smoke tests and CI/CD validation**  
   Deploy to staging, verify build health through sanity checks, and ensure your CI/CD pipeline runs reliably for frontend and backend.

## üöÄ DURING DEPLOYMENT

Time to go live ‚Äî this phase ensures a clean, error-free push to production.

1. **Code deployment and database migration**  
   Deploy the code to the production server. Run database migration scripts while monitoring for schema mismatch or migration errors.

2. **Update application configurations**  
   Review and update `.env` and runtime configs for new services or features. Include updated API keys, endpoints, or secrets.

3. **Package installation and dependency setup**  
   Ensure that all required third-party libraries are installed via `npm`, `pip`, or other package managers.

4. **Submit mobile builds to app stores (Mobile)**  
   Upload release builds to the Play Store or App Store for review and publishing.

5. **Cron job verification**  
   Add or update scheduled jobs (reporting, syncing, clean-up tasks). Confirm job frequency and environment match the specification.

## üìà POST DEPLOYMENT

Deployment doesn‚Äôt end with ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù ‚Äî your real users are just getting started.

1. **Remove maintenance page**  
   Make the live system accessible to users once deployment is verified.

2. **Smoke testing in production**  
   Verify all critical workflows ‚Äî login, registration, dashboard, payments, etc. ‚Äî work as expected in production.

3. **Clean up test data**  
   Delete any fake/test entries added during staging or smoke tests.

4. **24-hour vigilance by the team**  
   The project team should remain on standby. Monitor APM tools, logs, and real-time alerts. Be ready to respond to support tickets or user reports.

5. **Notify client and share release notes**  
   Communicate the successful deployment to the client along with:

   - Release notes
   - Deployment summary
   - Known issues (if any)
   - Feature walkthroughs

6. **Update documentation and project tools**

   - Finalize user guides, API docs, and changelogs
   - Update GitHub branches and tags
   - Update JIRA statuses or roadmap views

7. **Post-release review and lessons learned**  
   Conduct a release retrospective. What went well? What failed? Document lessons learned and update your checklist to improve next time.

8. **Monitor long-term performance and adoption**  
   Keep tracking app usage, error rates, and feedback. Look out for performance regressions, slow queries, or API failures. Use analytics to assess feature adoption and user experience.

Following this structured approach helps avoid surprises, ensures transparency across teams, and delivers the best experience to your end users. Remember ‚Äî a good release is not just about shipping features, but about doing it **safely, collaboratively, and confidently**.
