## **Module 1: The Transition from Engineer to Manager**

- **Session 1: Understanding the New Role & Mindset**
  - **Shifting from an Individual Contributor (IC) to a People Manager:** This Session explores the fundamental identity shift from being a "maker" to a "force multiplier." We'll discuss how your primary role changes from solving technical problems yourself to creating an environment where your team can solve them effectively. Your impact is now amplified through the success of others.
  - **Redefining "Success":** Success is no longer measured by lines of code written or features shipped personally. It's now measured by your team's overall output, their skill development, their engagement, and their ability to overcome challenges independently. We will work on creating a personal dashboard of metrics to track team health and progress.
  - **Common Challenges and Pitfalls:** A deep dive into the common traps for new engineering managers.
    - _Navigating Impostor Syndrome:_ Acknowledging and developing strategies to cope with the feeling that you are not qualified for the role.
    - _The Urge to Micromanage:_ Resisting the instinct to dictate _how_ work gets done and instead focusing on defining _what_ needs to be done and why.
    - _The Difficulty of Letting Go of Coding:_ Learning to delegate technical tasks to empower your team, even when you know you could do it faster yourself. We'll discuss how to transition your technical skills into architectural guidance, code reviews, and mentoring.
    - _The Hero Complex:_ Actively avoiding the tendency to swoop in and "save the day" when the team struggles, as this disempowers them in the long run.
- **Session 2: Developing a Leadership Mindset**
  - **Understanding Different Leadership Styles:** A practical exploration of servant, transformational, and situational leadership models. We will use scenario-based learning to identify which style is most effective in different contexts (e.g., leading a senior team vs. a junior team, managing during a crisis vs. a period of stability).
  - **Building Self-Awareness and Emotional Intelligence (EQ):** EQ is a critical skill for managers. We will break it down into five core components:
    - _Self-Awareness:_ Identifying your own strengths, weaknesses, triggers, and biases.
    - _Self-Regulation:_ Managing your emotional responses, especially under pressure.
    - _Motivation:_ Understanding your own drive to lead.
    - _Empathy:_ The ability to understand and share the feelings of your team members.
    - _Social Skills:_ Building rapport and navigating complex social situations.
  - **Time Management and Prioritization for Managers:** Moving from a "maker's schedule" (long, uninterrupted blocks of time) to a "manager's schedule" (fragmented and meeting-driven). We will introduce frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) and strategies for protecting your team's focus while effectively managing your own calendar and energy.

## **Module 2: Building and Leading High-Performing Teams**

- **Session 1: The Art and Science of Effective Communication**
  - **Active Listening:** Learning techniques to listen for understanding, not just to respond. This includes paraphrasing to confirm understanding, asking powerful, open-ended questions to encourage deeper thinking, and paying attention to non-verbal cues.
  - **Providing Clear and Constructive Feedback:** Mastering feedback delivery is crucial. We will practice using frameworks like Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) to deliver specific, actionable feedback. We will also introduce the "Radical Candor" model (Care Personally, Challenge Directly) to build a culture where feedback is seen as a gift.
  - **Running Effective 1-on-1s and Team Meetings:** Transforming meetings from status updates into valuable conversations. We'll provide templates for structuring meetings with clear agendas and desired outcomes, ensuring 1-on-1s are employee-led conversations focused on career growth, challenges, and well-being, not just project status.
  - **Communicating Technical Concepts:** Developing the skill of translating complex technical information for non-technical stakeholders (e.g., product, sales, marketing). This involves using analogies, focusing on user impact, and building alignment across different departments.
- **Session 2: Motivation, Engagement, and Empowerment**
  - **Understanding Intrinsic Motivation for Engineers:** Applying frameworks like Daniel Pink's "Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose." We'll brainstorm concrete ways to provide these:
    - _Autonomy:_ Giving engineers ownership over their projects, tools, and technical decisions.
    - _Mastery:_ Providing opportunities for skill development through challenging work, training budgets, and mentorship.
    - _Purpose:_ Clearly connecting the team's work to the company's mission and the problems you are solving for customers.
  - **Creating a Culture of Psychological Safety:** This is the foundation of a high-performing team. We will discuss actionable strategies for fostering an environment where team members feel safe to take risks, ask questions, admit mistakes, and challenge the status quo without fear of punishment. This includes implementing "blameless post-mortems" and celebrating "intelligent failures" as learning opportunities.
  - **Delegation and Empowerment:** Learning to delegate effectively is about more than just offloading tasks; it's a primary tool for developing your people. We will cover how to match tasks to individual skill levels and growth goals, providing the right level of context and support without micromanaging.
- **Session 3: Modern Performance Management**
  - **Setting Clear Goals and Expectations:** Moving beyond vague directives to collaboratively setting clear goals using frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals. This ensures that individual contributions are clearly aligned with team and company objectives.
  - **Conducting Fair and Effective Performance Reviews:** Shifting from a dreaded annual review to a system of continuous feedback and coaching. We will cover how to gather 360-degree feedback, write evidence-based reviews that reduce bias, and facilitate a two-way conversation focused on future growth.
  - **Managing Underperformance:** Proactively identifying and addressing performance issues with empathy, curiosity, and a clear, documented plan. We will walk through the steps of creating a supportive Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) that clearly outlines expectations, provides resources for improvement, and defines a timeline and consequences.

## **Module 3: Talent Acquisition and Strategic Hiring**

- **Session 1: Strategic Headcount Planning**
  - **Identifying Team Needs and Defining Roles:** Conducting a skills gap analysis to understand the capabilities your team has versus what it needs for future projects. This involves thinking about creating a balanced team of "T-shaped" individuals (deep expertise in one area, broad knowledge in others).
  - **Working Effectively with HR/Recruiting Teams:** Building a strong, collaborative partnership with your recruiting team. This means providing them with a clear "intake" of the role, defining a compelling employee value proposition, and establishing a communication cadence to keep the pipeline moving.
- **Session 2: Crafting an Effective and Inclusive Hiring Process**
  - **Writing Compelling and Inclusive Job Descriptions:** Learning to write job descriptions that attract a diverse pool of candidates by focusing on the impact of the role and the growth opportunities, rather than an exhaustive list of technical requirements. We will cover how to use language that is inclusive and welcoming.
  - **Designing Technical and Behavioral Interviews:** Creating a balanced and structured interview loop that accurately assesses technical competence, problem-solving skills, and alignment with team values. We will explore alternatives to high-pressure whiteboard coding, such as practical work-sample tests or pair programming exercises.
  - **Reducing Bias in the Hiring Process:** Acknowledging that unconscious bias is real and implementing techniques to mitigate it. This includes using structured interviews with predefined questions and scoring rubrics, ensuring diverse interview panels, and conducting "de-biasing" calibration meetings.
- **Session 3: Interviewing, Selection, and Closing**
  - **Conducting Structured Interviews:** Learning how to ask consistent, open-ended behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about a time when...") to gather evidence of past performance as a predictor of future success.
  - **Evaluating Candidates and Making Decisions:** Facilitating a calibration meeting with the interview panel to synthesize all feedback, discuss differing perspectives, and reach a data-informed consensus.
  - **Selling the Company and Role:** The hiring process is a two-way street. We will cover how to articulate a compelling vision for the team and personalize the pitch to a candidate's stated career goals. The goal is to ensure a world-class candidate experience from the first contact to the final offer.

## **Module 4: Talent Development and Long-Term Retention**

- **Session 1: Onboarding and Integration**
  - **Creating a Structured Onboarding Experience:** Designing a comprehensive 30-60-90 day plan that guides new hires from initial orientation to full productivity.
    - _First 30 Days:_ Focus on learning, meeting the team, understanding the codebase, and shipping a small, low-risk feature.
    - _First 60 Days:_ Begin contributing to more significant projects and taking on more ownership.
    - _First 90 Days:_ Operating with increasing independence and starting to identify areas for improvement in processes or code.
  - **Setting Up New Hires for Success:** The first week is critical. We will cover the importance of assigning a dedicated onboarding buddy, ensuring their development environment is ready on day one, and planning for early wins to build confidence and momentum.
- **Session 2: Career Development and Coaching**
  - **Understanding Individual Career Aspirations:** Holding regular, dedicated career conversations to understand each team member's long-term goals. This includes discussing the "dual-career ladder" and helping them decide between the individual contributor (IC) and management tracks.
  - **Creating Growth Plans and Opportunities:** Collaborating with each team member to create a personalized development plan. This involves identifying projects, mentorship opportunities, and training that align with their goals and stretch their skills.
  - **Mentoring vs. Coaching:** Understanding the crucial difference between these two approaches. Mentoring is about sharing your knowledge and experience, while coaching is about asking powerful questions to help them find their own answers. A great manager knows when to wear which hat.
- **Session 3: Strategies for Retaining Top Talent**
  - **Recognition and Rewards:** Learning to recognize contributions in a timely, specific, and meaningful way. We will discuss the impact of both public and private recognition, as well as monetary and non-monetary rewards, to make team members feel valued.
  - **Creating a Positive and Inclusive Team Culture:** Actively modeling and enforcing inclusive behaviors. This includes strategies like rotating meeting facilitators, amplifying quiet voices, ensuring remote team members have an equal presence, and creating a team charter that defines shared values and norms.
  - **Conducting "Stay" Interviews:** Don't wait for the exit interview to find out what's wrong. We will practice conducting proactive "stay" interviews with engaged employees to understand what they enjoy about their work, what keeps them at the company, and what could be improved.

## **Module 5: Navigating Team Dynamics and Constructive Conflict**

- **Session 1: Understanding and Shaping Team Dynamics**
  - **Tuckman's Stages of Group Development:** Recognizing where your team is in the Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing cycle. We will discuss specific manager actions for each stage, such as providing clear direction in "Forming," facilitating open discussion in "Storming," and empowering the team in "Performing."
  - **Building a Cohesive and Collaborative Team:** Fostering connections and a shared identity through intentional team-building activities, creating shared rituals (e.g., weekly demo days, social lunches), and celebrating team wins together.
- **Session 2: Effective Conflict Resolution**
  - **Identifying the Root Causes of Conflict:** Differentiating between constructive, task-based conflict (which should be encouraged) and destructive, interpersonal conflict (which must be addressed).
  - **Mediation and Facilitation Techniques:** Learning a step-by-step process for acting as a neutral third party to help team members resolve their disagreements. This involves active listening, finding common ground, and guiding them toward a mutually agreeable solution.
  - **Fostering a Culture of Healthy Debate:** Encouraging the team to "disagree and commit." This means creating an environment where diverse perspectives are sought out and debated respectfully before a final decision is made, ensuring everyone feels heard and can rally behind the chosen path.

## **Final Project / Capstone**

- **Develop a "My Leadership Philosophy" Document.**
  - Participants will create a personal leadership manifesto. This document will require them to articulate their core values as a leader and write specific "I will..." statements for handling various scenarios, such as when a project is late, when a team member is struggling, how they will run 1-on-1s, and how they will measure their own success as a manager.
- **Create a 90-Day Plan for Their Team.**
  - Participants will apply the concepts learned to create a strategic plan for their current or future team, focusing on a key area for improvement (e.g., improving code quality, streamlining a process, or enhancing team morale). The plan must include specific, measurable actions, clear timelines, success metrics, and a communication plan for stakeholders.
