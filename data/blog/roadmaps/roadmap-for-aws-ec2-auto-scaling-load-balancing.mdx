## AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, stands as the backbone of scalable and flexible cloud computing within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. EC2 empowers users to launch virtual servers in the cloud, allowing them to effortlessly scale compute capacity up or down based on demand. As the foundational service in AWS, EC2 offers a diverse range of instance types to accommodate various workloads, coupled with the flexibility to choose operating systems and configure instances to meet specific requirements. In this journey of understanding EC2, we will explore the essentials of launching and managing instances, delve into advanced concepts such as storage and instance purchasing options, and ultimately equip ourselves to architect robust and resilient applications in the cloud. Let’s embark on this exploration of EC2, a pivotal component that forms the cornerstone of cloud infrastructure on AWS.

## Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling is a pivotal feature within Amazon Web Services (AWS) that revolutionizes the dynamics of cloud computing. Designed to dynamically adjust computing resources to meet varying application demands, Auto Scaling ensures optimal performance and cost-efficiency by automatically scaling the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in traffic. This indispensable AWS service enables users to define scaling policies based on specific conditions, such as increased load or traffic patterns, facilitating seamless adaptation to fluctuating workloads. By distributing applications across multiple instances and automatically adjusting capacity, Auto Scaling enhances system reliability, availability, and scalability, making it an essential tool for architects and developers seeking to build resilient and efficient cloud infrastructures. This roadmap explores the fundamentals of Auto Scaling, guiding users from the basics of configuration to the intricacies of advanced policies, ultimately empowering them to orchestrate a dynamic and responsive environment in the AWS cloud.
