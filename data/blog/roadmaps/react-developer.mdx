## Overview

Everything that is there to learn about React and the ecosystem.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

## Level 1: React Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They let us split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)**
- **[Components in Depth](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)**
- **[Explore the different types of components in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-types/)**
- **[What is the difference between components, elements, and instances?](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-element-component/)**

### Class Components

Components can either be created using the class based approach or a functional approach. These components are simple classes (made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application). All class based components are child classes for the Component class of ReactJS.
Although the class components are supported in React, it is encouraged to write functional components and make use of hooks in modern React applications.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Components and Props](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react#props-vs-state)**
• **[Is There Any Reason to Still Use React Class Components?](https://medium.com/geekculture/is-there-any-reason-to-still-use-react-class-components-9b6a1e6aa9ef)**
• **[Functional Components vs Class Components in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react)**
• **[Migrate Class Components to Functional Components with Hooks in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-migration/)**

### Functional Components

Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree. Functional components can also have state which is managed using React hooks.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)**
• **[Your first component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)**
• **[Passing props to a component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)**
• **[Functional Components in React (1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-functional-components/)**
• **[Functional Components in React (2)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component/)**

### **Props and States**

Props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of component render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Component State](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html)**
• **[How to use Props in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component/)**
• **[What is the difference between state and props in React?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27991366/what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props-in-react)**
• **[How to update state from props in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-derive-state-props/)**
• **[Putting props to useState](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/putting-props-to-use-state)**

### Composition and Inheritance

React has a powerful composition model, and it is recommended to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.
Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)**
- **[How to perform component composition in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition/)**
- **[Achieving Reusability With React Composition](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/)**

### **Refs**

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch.
Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Refs and DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)**
- **[Referencing Values with Refs](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)**
- **[Manipulating the DOM with Refs](https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)**
- **[Examples of using refs in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-ref/)**
- **[The Complete Guide to useRef() and Refs in React](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useref-guide/)**
- **[Learn useRef in 11 Minutes - Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2ypzz6gJm0)**

### Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
• React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
• With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Handling Events in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)**
• **[Synthetic Events in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)**
• **[Responding to Events](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events)**
• **[React Event Handler](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-event-handler/)**

### **Higher Order Component**

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[High-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)**
- **[How to create a Higher-Order Component](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-higher-order-components/)**

## Level 2: React Routers and State management

Routing is an essential concept in Single Page Applications (SPA). When your application is divided into separated logical sections, and all of them are under their own URL, your users can easily share links among each other. Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[How to use Routing in React JS: A Comprehensive Guide.](https://teachingbee.in/how-to-use-routing-in-react-js/)**
- **[React Router 6 – Tutorial for Beginners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59IXY5IDrBA)**

### **React Router**

React router is the most famous library when it comes to implementing routing in React applications. Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[React Router — Official Website](https://reactrouter.com/)**
- **[Getting Started Guide](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial)**
- **[React Router v6 in 1 hour](https://youtu.be/0cSVuySEB0A)**
- **[How to use React Router v6](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-router/)**
- **[React Router Cheat Sheet](https://stackdiary.com/guides/react-router-cheat-sheet-reference/)**

### Reach Router

Reach Router is a small, simple router for React that borrows from React Router, Ember, and Preact Router. Reach Router has a small footprint, supports only simple route patterns by design, and has strong (but experimental) accessibility features.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Reach Router — Official Website](https://reach.tech/router/)**
• **[Getting Started Guide](https://reach.tech/router/tutorial/01-intro)**

### State Management in React

Application state management is the process of maintaining knowledge of an application’s inputs across multiple related data flows that form a complete business transaction — or a session — to understand the condition of the app at any given moment. In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of an application according to its stored inputs — saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[What is State Management?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/state-management)**
- **[Overview of State in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state/)**

![state-management.png](/static/images/roadmaps/react/state-management.png)

### Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Passing Data Deeply with Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)**
• **[State with useContext and useState/useReducer](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext/)**

### Zustand

Zustand is a small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy api based on hooks, isn’t boilerplatey or opinionated.

Zustand is often used as an alternative to other state management libraries, such as Redux and MobX, because of its simplicity and small size. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized applications, where the complexity of larger state management libraries is not required.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Zustand - Official Website](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)**

### **MobX**

MobX is an open source state management tool. MobX, a simple, scalable, and standalone state management library, follows functional reactive programming (FRP) implementation and prevents inconsistent state by ensuring that all derivations are performed automatically.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[MobX Official Website](https://mobx.js.org/)**
- **[Intro to MobX Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQQq1QbYlAw)**

### Redux Toolkit

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as **[live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools)**.

Redux Toolkit (RTK) is a library for managing state in JavaScript applications. It is an opinionated set of tools and utilities for building Redux applications, and it is designed to make it easier and faster to build Redux applications.

RTK is often used as an alternative to writing Redux applications from scratch, as it provides a set of conventions and utilities that can make it easier and faster to build Redux applications.

- **[Redux Tutorial - Beginner to Advanced](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zrs7u6bdbUw)**

### Recoil

Recoil is a library for managing state in React applications.

Recoil is designed to be easy to use and efficient, with a focus on improving the performance and scalability of large, complex React applications. It is based on the concept of atoms and selectors, which are used to manage the state of a component. Atoms represent the state of a component, and selectors are used to derive new state from atoms.

Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[Recoil - Official Website](https://recoiljs.org/)**

## Level 3: Forms and React Hooks

Although you can build forms using vanilla React, it normally requires a lot of boilerplate code. This is because the form is built using a combination of state and props. To make it easier to manage forms, we use some sort of library.
Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[How to use Forms in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-form/)**

### **React hook form**

React hook form is an opensource form library for react. Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

## Level 5: API Calls

APIs, short for Application Programming Interfaces, are software-to-software interfaces. Meaning, they allow different applications to talk to each other and exchange information or functionality. This allows businesses to access another business’s data, piece of code, software, or services in order to extend the functionality of their own products — all while saving time and money. There are several options available to make API calls from your React.js applications.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[AJAX and APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)**

### **urql**

urql (Universal React Query Library) is a library for managing GraphQL data in React applications. It is developed and maintained by Formidable Labs and is available as open-source software.

urql is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with a simple API for performing GraphQL queries and mutations. It is based on the concept of a client, which is used to manage the GraphQL data for an application. • **[urql - Formidable Labs](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)**

### Relay

Relay is a JavaScript client used in the browser to fetch GraphQL data. It’s a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook for managing and fetching data in React applications. It is built with scalability in mind in order to power complex applications like Facebook. The ultimate goal of GraphQL and Relay is to deliver instant UI-response interactions.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Official Website](https://relay.dev/)**
- **[Introduction to Relay modern](https://relay.dev/docs/)**

### Apollo (Recommended)

Apollo is a platform for building a unified graph, a communication layer that helps you manage the flow of data between your application clients (such as web and native apps) and your back-end services.

### SWR

SWR is a React Hooks library for data fetching. The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

With just one hook, you can significantly simplify the data fetching logic in your project.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[SWR: React Hooks for Data Fetching](https://swr.vercel.app/)**

Visit the following resources to learn more:
• **[RTK Query - Official Website](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)**

## Level 6: React Frameworks

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique for rendering a JavaScript application on the server, rather than in the browser. This can improve the performance and user experience of a web application, as the initial render of the application is done on the server and the content is sent to the browser as a fully-rendered HTML page.
There are several frameworks and libraries available for server-side rendering React applications, most common being:
• **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**
• **[Remix](https://remix.run/)**

![frameworks.png](/static/images/roadmaps/react/frameworks.png)

For full inspiration and vision, see Redwood's [README](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/README.md).

## Level 7: Testing your applications

Before delivering your application to users, you need to be sure that your app meets the requirements it was designed for, and that it doesn’t do any weird, unintended things (called ‘bugs’). To accomplish this, we ‘test’ our applications in different ways.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[A comprehensive dive into software testing.](https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/software-testing/)**

### **React Testing Library**

The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
