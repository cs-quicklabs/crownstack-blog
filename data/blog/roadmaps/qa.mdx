<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

## Level 1: QA Introduction

### QA Basics

The phrase “fit for use or purpose” sums up quality, which is incredibly difficult to define. It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product’s usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.

Assurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.

Quality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.

#### What is Quality

Quality is extremely hard to define, and it is simply stated: “Fit for use or purpose.” It is all about meeting the needs and expectations of customers concerning the functionality, design, reliability, durability, & price of the product.

#### What is Assurance

Assurance is nothing but a positive declaration of a product or service, which gives confidence. It is certain of a product or a service which it will work well. It provides a guarantee that the product will work without any problems as per the expectations or requirements.

#### Quality Assurance in Software Testing

Quality Assurance in Software Testing is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of software products or services provided to the customers by an organization. Quality assurance focuses on improving the **[software development process](https://www.guru99.com/software-development-life-cycle-tutorial.html)** and making it efficient and effective per the quality standards defined for software products. Quality Assurance is popularly known as QA Testing.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[What is Quality Assurance(QA)? Process, Methods, Examples](https://www.guru99.com/all-about-quality-assurance.html)**
- **[What Do Software Testers Do?](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/what-do-software-testers-do-version-0-1)**

#### Tester Mindset

As a Quality Assurance Engineer, your job is to look for the weak spots in a product, whatever that product may be, and report them back, so that they can be fixed and thus, the product you are working on can be of the highest quality possible.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[The Software Tester’s Mindset](https://softwaretester.careers/the-software-testers-mindset/)**
- **[How to Think Like a Tester](https://medium.com/@blakenorrish/how-to-think-like-a-tester-7a174ff6aeaf)**

#### Test Oracles

A test oracle is a mechanism; different from the program itself that can be used to check the correctness of the program’s output for the test cases. Conceptually, we can consider testing a process in which the test cases are given to the test oracle and the program under testing.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[What are Test Oracles](https://ecomputernotes.com/software-engineering/what-are-test-oracles)**

#### Test Prioritization

Test prioritization is ordering the test cases to be conducted eventually. Prioritizing test cases aids to meet two important constraints, namely time and budget in software testing to enhance the fault detection rate as early as possible.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[A Tour of what is Test Prioritization?](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/test-case-prioritization)**

- **[Learn about Test Prioritization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/test-case-prioritization-in-software-testing/)**
- **[Test Prioritization fundamentals!](https://testomat.io/features/test-case-priorities/)**

## Level 2: Testing Approaches

Test approach has two techniques: Proactive - An approach in which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to find and fix the defects before the build is created. Reactive - An approach in which the testing is not started until after design and coding are completed.

Three approaches are commonly used to implement functional testing:

#### White Box Testing

White Box Testing is a technique in which software’s internal structure, design, and coding are tested to verify input-output flow and improve design, usability, and security. In white box testing, code is visible to testers, so it is also called Clear box testing, Open box testing, Transparent box testing, Code-based testing, and Glass box testing.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[A Complete Guide With Techniques, Examples, & Tools](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/white-box-testing-techniques-with-example/)**

#### Gray Box Testing

Gray box testing is a software testing technique to test a software product or application with partial knowledge of the internal structure of the application. The purpose of gray box testing is to search and identify the defects due to improper code structure or improper use of applications.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[What is Gray Box Testing? Techniques & Example](https://www.guru99.com/grey-box-testing.html)**

#### Black box testing

Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the functionalities of software applications are tested without having knowledge of internal code structure, implementation details and internal paths. Black Box Testing mainly focuses on input and output of software applications and it is entirely based on software requirements and specifications. It is also known as Behavioral Testing.

- **[IBM Accessibility Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/able/)**

#### Automated Testing

Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.

Automated testing is the application of software tools to automate a human-driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product. Most modern agile and DevOps software projects now include automated testing from inception. To fully appreciate the value of automated testing, however, it helps to understand what life was like before it was widely adopted.

#### Caching

Caching ensures that the resources downloaded once are reused instead of doing a fresh fetch again. It is useful for increasing subsequent page load speed by reusing cached images, fonts, and other static assets. Caching should not be typically done on dynamic content. For example list of posts or comments. Visit the following resources to learn more:

- **[Caching - Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0)**

### SWAs, PWAs and Jamstack

#### SWAs

A Static Web Application is any web application that can be delivered directly to an end user’s browser without any server-side alteration of the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript content. While this can encompass very flat, unchanging sites like a corporate web site, static web applications generally refer to rich sites that utilize technologies in the browser instead of on the server to deliver dynamic content.

#### PWAs

At their heart, Progressive Web Apps are just web applications. Using progressive enhancement, new capabilities are enabled in modern browsers. Using service workers and a web app manifest, your web application becomes reliable and installable. If the new capabilities aren’t available, users still get the core experience.

#### Jamstack

Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability. Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience. It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.

#### CSR vs SSR

CSR stands for Client Side Rendering and SSR stands for Server Side Rendering. CSR pages are computed in your machine and then shown by your browser while in the case of SSR, the server sends ready to show Html content directly. Primarily React, Vue, and Angular apps are examples of CSR (technically it is possible for them to be executed in SSR mode too) and almost all older tech stacks are SSR like PHP, ruby on rails, java, dot net, etc. Visit the following resources to learn more:

#### Responsive vs adaptive

There are two approaches to ensuring a website is optimized for mobile, tablet, laptop and PC screens: responsive design and adaptive design. While both are intended to solve the same problem, they use different strategies.

#### What is responsive design?

A website created with responsive design serves up the same site to every device, but that site is fluid and will change its layout and appearance based on the size and orientation of the device. Developers use CSS to ensure each page of the site can reformat based on the size of the user’s viewport and only need to create one codebase for the site. They use something called breakpoints to tell the site when to adjust to accommodate different screen sizes.

#### What is adaptive design?

In adaptive design, a different website layout is created for each device’s screen. As it loads, the site recognizes the size of the screen and serves up the layout that was made for that viewport. In fact, you can create a different user experience for each of six common screen sizes from very small to very large: 320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px and 1600px.

Adaptive is useful for retrofitting an existing site in order to make it more suitable for mobile phones. This allows you to take control of the design and web development for specific, multiple viewports. The number of viewports that you choose to design for is entirely up to you, your company, and your overall budget. It does, however, afford you a certain amount of control (for example over content and layout) that you will not necessarily have using responsive design.
