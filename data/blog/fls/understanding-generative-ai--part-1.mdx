### Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models capable of creating new content—such as text, images, music, or code—that mimics human creativity. Unlike traditional AI systems that analyze or classify existing data, generative models learn the underlying patterns and structures in data to produce original outputs.

The purpose of this blog is to provide a structured roadmap for understanding generative AI, focusing on key concepts and foundational knowledge that will help you navigate this exciting field. This is the first part of a series that will delve deeper into various aspects of generative AI.
