# Introduction to GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is GitHub’s native automation platform that enables teams to build CI/CD pipelines and automate workflows directly from their repositories. It allows you to run scripts, build applications, execute tests, perform code scans, and deploy services based on repository events.

---

## What Can GitHub Actions Be Used For?

GitHub Actions supports automation across frontend, backend, and QA workflows.

### For Frontend Teams

- Run ESLint and Prettier checks on every pull request
- Build React, Angular, or Next.js applications
- Run UI tests
- Deploy static frontend builds

### For Backend Teams

- Run unit and integration tests
- Build and package services
- Run security and dependency scans
- Deploy APIs or serverless functions

### For QA Teams

- Trigger automated test suites
- Run regression or smoke tests
- Generate and publish test reports
- Schedule periodic quality checks

## CI, CD, and Where GitHub Actions Fits

### Continuous Integration (CI)

CI automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are pushed or a pull request is created.

### Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)

CD automates the delivery of tested code to staging or production.

### Where GitHub Actions Fits

GitHub Actions acts as the automation layer in CI/CD by:

- Listening to repository events
- Running workflows for build, test, scan, and deploy
- Integrating with GitHub pull requests and branch protection rules

**CI/CD with GitHub Actions:**

## Core Concepts of GitHub Actions

### 1. Adding GitHub Actions to a Repository

GitHub Actions is configured using workflow files placed under:

```text
.github/workflows/
```

Each workflow is a YAML file that defines triggers, jobs, and steps.

**Workflow syntax reference:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

---

### 2. Events

Events trigger workflows. Common types include:

- `push` – when code is pushed
- `pull_request` – when a PR is created or updated
- `schedule` – run workflows using a cron expression
- `workflow_dispatch` – manually trigger a workflow

**Events reference:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)

---

### 3. Workflows

A **workflow** defines:

- When it runs
- What jobs it runs
- In what order

Workflows can run one or multiple jobs in parallel or sequentially.

**Workflows guide:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows)

---

### 4. Jobs

A **job** is a collection of steps that run on the same runner.

- Jobs can run in parallel
- Jobs can depend on each other
- Each job runs in an isolated environment

**Jobs reference:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow)

---

### 5. Runners (GitHub-Hosted Only)

Runners are machines that execute jobs.
In this guide, we use **GitHub-hosted runners**, such as:

- `ubuntu-latest`
- `windows-latest`
- `macos-latest`

These runners are managed by GitHub and require no setup.

**Runners guide:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)

---

### 6. Steps

Steps are individual tasks inside a job.
A step can either:

- Run shell commands
- Use a prebuilt action

Steps execute in order and can share data using environment variables or files.

**Steps reference:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-steps-in-a-job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-steps-in-a-job)

---

### 7. Actions (Official Only)

Actions are reusable units of work.
In this guide, we use only official GitHub actions such as:

- `actions/checkout` – checks out repository code
- `actions/setup-node` – sets up a Node.js environment
- `actions/upload-artifact` – uploads build outputs or reports

**Official actions:**
[https://github.com/actions](https://github.com/actions)

---

## Sample Workflows

### 1. Basic Workflow: List All Files in the Repo

**Purpose**

- Understand workflow structure
- Learn about jobs, steps, and runners

**What It Does**

- Triggered on every push
- Checks out repository code
- Runs `ls` to list all files

**Key Concepts Used**

- `push` event
- `actions/checkout`
- GitHub-hosted runner

---

### 2. Run JS/TS Lint on Pull Requests

**Purpose**

- Enforce code quality
- Catch lint issues before merge

**What It Does**

- Triggered on `pull_request`
- Sets up Node.js
- Installs dependencies
- Runs ESLint or a TypeScript linter
- Fails the PR if lint errors are found

**Relevant action:**
[https://github.com/actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)

---

### 3. Daily Static Code Scan with Email Report

**Purpose**

- Automate scheduled quality checks
- Share scan results with the team

**What It Does**

- Triggered using a scheduled cron event
- Runs a static code scan (for example, ESLint or a security scanner)
- Generates a report file
- Uploads the report as an artifact
- Emails the report to a configured email address

**Schedule events:**
[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

**Artifacts action:**
[https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)

---
