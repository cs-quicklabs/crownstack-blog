### Introduction to Generative AI

In the [first part of our series on generative AI](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/fls/understanding-generative-ai--part-1), we explored foundational concepts and basic applications. In this second part, we will delve deeper into advanced models, multimodal capabilities, and practical applications of generative AI.

### Key topics to understand in Generative AI - Part 2

- Multimodal Models
- Diffusion Models
- Making an app using Supervised Learning VS using Generative AI
- How to improve performance of Generative AI models
    - Better prompting
    - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Fine-tuning models
    - Pre-training models
- How to choose suitable LLM for your applications
    - Choose by model size
    - Open-source or Closed-source
- What is instruction tuning
- What is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)


### Recommended Course

I highly recommend the [Generative AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-for-everyone) course on Coursera. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to AI, covering the essential concepts and technologies that form the backbone of modern AI applications. It's perfect for beginners and offers a solid foundation before moving on to more specialized topics.
