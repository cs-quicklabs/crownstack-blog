### Send Requests

Sending HTTP requests is the cornerstone of Postman, making it easy to interact with APIs. This section covers everything you need to create, customize, and manage requests, from setting parameters and headers to handling authentication and variables. Whether you're testing a single endpoint or building complex workflows, you’ll learn how to streamline your API interactions.
