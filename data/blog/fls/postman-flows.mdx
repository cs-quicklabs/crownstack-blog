### Introduction to Postman Flows

Postman Flows is a visual programming tool inside Postman that allows you to create API workflows without writing code. Instead of scripting tests or chaining requests manually, you can drag, drop, and connect blocks (like LEGO) to automate sequences of API calls, logic, and conditions.

### Build Flows

Postman Collections let you organize and automate API requests, acting like a folder for grouping related calls. This section explores creating, managing, and running collections to save time and enhance collaboration. Perfect for keeping your API testing structured and shareable with your team.
