This section of the blog is dedicated to document all the coding best practices we follow at Crownstack. Our software engineers do a lots of peer code reviews. During these code reviews, we saw  pattern of different developers not following the same best practices in their individual projects. We decided to document all these coding best practices here that we identify and share it with everyone at Crownstack and on the Internet.

We have distributed our best practices technology-wise for proper classification and easy navigation. Please go through the most suitable section to continue:
