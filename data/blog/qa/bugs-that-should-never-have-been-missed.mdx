## Overview

When developers finish their work and submit builds to testers or designers, they start to get a lot of objections from QA and designers on small things like spacing, error messaging, alignment, text sizes etc. This is because they are not aware of the small things that can make a big difference in the user experience. This not only wastes their time but QA also start to focus on minor things rather than testing the actual workflows of application. If few things can be taken care at develooper's end before giving builds to testers, a lot of time can be saved. This article is a list of things that should never have been missed by developers.
