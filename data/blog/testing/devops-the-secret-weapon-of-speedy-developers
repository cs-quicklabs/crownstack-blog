Moreover, DevOps promotes the use of automation, which can greatly benefit QA engineers. Automated testing tools can save time and ensure more reliable results, allowing QA engineers to focus on more complex test scenarios. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key aspects of DevOps, which involve frequent code changes that are automatically tested and deployed.

Furthermore, the collaborative nature of DevOps encourages better communication between developers, operations, and QA engineers, leading to quicker resolution of issues and more efficient workflows.

# Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is basically a combination of two words- **Dev**elopment and **Op**eration**s**. DevOps is a culture that implements the technology in order to promote collaboration between the developer team and the operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way.

### Why DevOps?

The goal of DevOps is to increase an organization’s speed when it comes to delivering applications and services. Many companies have successfully implemented DevOps to enhance their user experience including Amazon, Netflix, etc.

Facebook’s mobile app which is updated every two weeks effectively tells users you can have what you want and you can have it. Now ever wondered how Facebook was able to do social smoothing? It’s the DevOps philosophy that helps Facebook ensure that apps aren’t outdated and that users get the best experience on Facebook. Facebook accomplishes this true code ownership model that makes its developers responsible that includes testing and supporting through production and delivery for each kernel of code. They write and update their true policies like this but Facebook has developed a DevOps culture and has successfully accelerated its development lifecycle.

Industries have started to gear up for digital transformation by shifting their means to weeks and months instead of years while maintaining high quality as a result.  The solution to all this is- DevOps.

### **How DevOps is different from Traditional IT?**

Traditional IT has 1000s lines of code and is created by different teams with different standards whereas DevOps is created by one team with intimate knowledge of the product. Traditional IT is complex to understand and DevOps is easily understandable.

### **DevOps Lifecycle**

 DevOps lifecycle is the methodology where professional development teams come together to bring products to market more efficiently and quickly. The structure of the DevOps lifecycle consists of Plan, Code, Building, Test, Releasing, Deploying, Operating,  and Monitoring.

![img2](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\img2.png)

# Different Phases of the DevOps Lifecycle

- **Plan:** Determining the commercial needs and gathering the opinions of end-user by professionals in this level of the DevOps lifecycle.
- **Code:** At this level, the code for the same is developed and in order to simplify the design, the team of developers uses tools and extensions that take care of security problems.
- **Build:** After the coding part, programmers use various tools for the submission of the code to the common code source.
- **Test:** This level is very important to assure software integrity. Various sorts of tests are done such as user acceptability testing, safety testing, speed testing, and many more.
- **Release:** At this level, everything is ready to be deployed in the operational environment.
- **Deploy:** In this level, Infrastructure-as-Code assists in creating the operational infrastructure and subsequently publishes the build using various DevOps lifecycle tools.
- **Operate:** At this level, the available version is ready for users to use. Here, the department looks after the server configuration and deployment.
- **Monitor:** The observation is done at this level that depends on the data which is gathered from consumer behavior, the efficiency of applications, and from various other sources.

### **Advantages:**

1. Faster Delivery: DevOps enables organizations to release new products and updates faster and more frequently, which can lead to a competitive advantage.
2. Improved Collaboration: DevOps promotes collaboration between development and operations teams, resulting in better communication, increased efficiency, and reduced friction.
3. Improved Quality: DevOps emphasizes automated testing and continuous integration, which helps to catch bugs early in the development process and improve the overall quality of software.
4. Increased Automation: DevOps enables organizations to automate many manual processes, freeing up time for more strategic work and reducing the risk of human error.
5. Better Scalability: DevOps enables organizations to quickly and efficiently scale their infrastructure to meet changing demands, improving the ability to respond to business needs.
6. Increased Customer Satisfaction: DevOps helps organizations to deliver new features and updates more quickly, which can result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
7. Improved Security: DevOps promotes security best practices, such as continuous testing and monitoring, which can help to reduce the risk of security breaches and improve the overall security of an organization’s systems.
8. Better Resource Utilization: DevOps enables organizations to optimize their use of resources, including hardware, software, and personnel, which can result in cost savings and improved efficiency.

### **Disadvantages:**

1. High Initial Investment: Implementing DevOps can be a complex and costly process, requiring significant investment in technology, infrastructure, and personnel.
2. Skills Shortage: Finding qualified DevOps professionals can be a challenge, and organizations may need to invest in training and development programs to build the necessary skills within their teams.
3. Resistance to Change: Some employees may resist the cultural and organizational changes required for successful DevOps adoption, which can result in resistance, resistance to collaboration, and reduced efficiency.
4. Lack of Standardization: DevOps is still a relatively new field, and there is a lack of standardization in terms of methodologies, tools, and processes. This can make it difficult for organizations to determine the best approach for their specific needs.
5. Increased Complexity: DevOps can increase the complexity of software delivery, requiring organizations to manage a larger number of moving parts and integrate multiple systems and tools.
6. Dependency on Technology: DevOps relies heavily on technology, and organizations may need to invest in a variety of tools and platforms to support the DevOps process.
7. Need for Continuous Improvement: DevOps requires ongoing improvement and adaptation, as new technologies and best practices emerge. Organizations must be prepared to continuously adapt and evolve their DevOps practices to remain competitive.

# DevOps Architecture Features

Here are some key features of DevOps architecture, such as:

### 1) Automation

Automation can reduce time consumption, especially during the testing and deployment phase. The productivity increases, and releases are made quicker by automation. This will lead in catching bugs quickly so that it can be fixed easily. For contiguous delivery, each code is defined through automated tests, cloud-based services, and builds. This promotes production using automated deploys.

![img3](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\img3.png)

### 2) Collaboration

The Development and Operations team collaborates as a DevOps team, which improves the cultural model as the teams become more productive with their productivity, which strengthens accountability and ownership. The teams share their responsibilities and work closely in sync, which in turn makes the deployment to production faster.

### 3) Integration

Applications need to be integrated with other components in the environment. The integration phase is where the existing code is combined with new functionality and then tested. Continuous integration and testing enable continuous development. The frequency in the releases and micro-services leads to significant operational challenges. To overcome such problems, continuous integration and delivery are implemented to deliver in a **quicker, safer**, and **reliable manner**.

### 4) Configuration management

It ensures the application to interact with only those resources that are concerned with the environment in which it runs. The configuration files are not created where the external configuration to the application is separated from the source code. The configuration file can be written during deployment, or they can be loaded at the run time, depending on the environment in which it is running.

# How DevOps Works?

DevOps is a software development methodology that improves the collaboration between developers and operations teams using various automation tools. These automation tools are implemented using various stages which are a part of the DevOps Lifecycle.

**Goal:** The goal of DevOps is to increase an organization speed when it comes to delivering applications and services. Many companies have successfully implemented devOps to enhance their user experience like amazon, netflix etc.

**Example:**

Facebook’s mobile app which is updated every two weeks effectively telling users you can have what you want and you can have it. Now ever wondered how facebook was able to do the social smoothing ? It’s the DevOps philosophy that helps facebook and sure that  apps aren’t outdated and that users get the best experience Facebook. Facebook accomplishes this true of code ownership model that makes its developers responsible that includes testing and supporting through production and delivery for each kernel of code. They write and update its true policies like this but Facebook has developed a DevOps culture and has successfully accelerated its development lifecycle.

Industries have started to gear up for the digital transformation by shifting their means to weeks and months instead of years while maintaining high quality as a result.  The solution to all this is- DevOps.

### How DevOps Works?

The DevOps Lifecycle divides the SDLC lifecycle into the following stages:

![logo1](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo1.png)

**Here are some common DevOps terms that QA engineers often interact with:**

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. It allows for early detection of integration bugs.
2. **Continuous Development:** This stage involves committing code to version control tools such as Git or SVN for maintaining the different versions of the code, and tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle for building/packaging the code into an executable file that can be forwarded to the QAs for testing.
3. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: This is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users.
4. **Configuration Management (CM)**: This is a system that tracks and controls the changes in the software, ensuring that all its working versions are well documented and tested.
5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: This is a type of IT setup wherein developers or operations teams automatically manage and provision the technology stack for an application, rather than using manual processes to configure discrete hardware devices and operating systems.
6. **Continuous Testing (Test Automation)**: This is the practice of running a suite of tests without manual intervention, allowing for more frequent and consistent testing.
7. **Version Control**: This is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
8. **Monitoring and Logging**: This involves the tracking and documentation of events in a software, helping to detect and solve problems.

# DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps is a practice that enables a single team to handle the whole application lifecycle, including development, testing, release, deployment, operation, display, and planning. It is a mix of the terms “Dev” (for development) and “Ops” (for operations). We can speed up the delivery of applications and services by a business with the aid of DevOps. Amazon, Netflix, and other businesses have all effectively embraced DevOps to improve their customer experience.

![img4](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\img4.png)

**DevOps Lifecycle** is the set of phases that includes **[DevOps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-devops/)** for taking part in **[Development](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/)** and Operation group duties for quicker software program delivery. DevOps follows positive techniques that consist of **code, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, displaying, and planning.** **DevOps lifecycle** follows a range of phases such as non-stop development, non-stop integration, non-stop testing, non-stop monitoring, and non-stop feedback. Each segment of the DevOps lifecycle is related to some equipment and applied sciences to obtain the process. Some of the frequently used tools are open source and are carried out primarily based on commercial enterprise requirements. DevOps lifecycle is effortless to manipulate and it helps satisfactory delivery.

# 7 Cs of DevOps

1. Continuous Development
2. Continuous Integration
3. Continuous Testing
4. Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery
5. Continuous Monitoring
6. Continuous Feedback
7. Continuous Operations

### 1. Continuous Development

In Continuous Development code is written in small, continuous bits rather than all at once, Continuous Development is important in DevOps because this improves efficiency every time a piece of code is created, it is tested, built, and deployed into production. Continuous Development raises the standard of the code and streamlines the process of repairing flaws, vulnerabilities, and defects. It facilitates developers’ ability to concentrate on creating high-quality code.

![logo2](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo2.png)

### 2. Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration can be explained mainly in 4 stages in DevOps. They are as follows:

1. Getting the SourceCode from SCM
2. Building the code
3. Code quality review
4. Storing the build artifacts

The stages mentioned above are the flow of Continuous Integration and we can use any of the tools that suit our requirement in each stage and of the most popular tools are **[GitHub](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-github/) for source code management(SCM)** when the developer develops the code on his local machine he pushes it to the remote repository which is GitHub from here who is having the access can Pull, clone and can make required changes to the code. From there by using **[Maven](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-apache-maven-build-automation-tool-java-projects/) we can build** them into the required package (war, jar, ear) and can test the Junit cases. **[SonarQube](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-security-testing-tools/) performs code quality reviews** where it will measure the quality of source code and generates a report in the form of HTML or PDF format. **Nexus for storing the build artifacts** will help us to store the **[artifacts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artifact-software-development/)** that are build by using Maven and this whole process is achieved by using a Continuous Integration tool **[Jenkins](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-jenkins/)**.

![logo3](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo3.png)

### 3. Continuous Testing

Any firm can deploy continuous testing with the use of the agile and DevOps methodologies. Depending on our needs, we can perform continuous testing using automation testing tools such as **Testsigma, [Selenium](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selenium-basics-components-features-uses-and-limitations/), [LambdaTest](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/lambdatest/),** etc. With these tools, we can test our code and prevent problems and code smells, as well as test more quickly and intelligently. With the aid of a continuous integration platform like Jenkins, the entire process can be automated, which is another added benefit.

![logo4](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo4.png)

### 4. Continuous Deployment/ Continuous Delivery

Continuous Deployment: **[Continuous Deployment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-continuous-deployment/)** is the process of automatically deploying an application into the production environment when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we’ll automate everything from obtaining the application’s source code to deploying it.

![logo5](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo5.png)

Continuous Delivery: **[Continuous Delivery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ci-cd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery/)** is the process of deploying an application into production servers manually when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we’ll automate the continuous integration processes, however, manual involvement is still required for deploying it to the production environment.

![logo7](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo7.png)

### 5. Continuous Monitoring

DevOps lifecycle is incomplete if there was no Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring can be achieved with the help of Prometheus and Grafana we can continuously monitor and can get notified before anything goes wrong with the help of Prometheus we can gather many performance measures, including CPU and memory utilization, network traffic, application response times, error rates, and others. Grafana makes it possible to visually represent and keep track of data from time series, such as CPU and memory utilization.

### 6. Continuous Feedback

Once the application is released into the market the end users will use the application and they will give us feedback about the performance of the application and any glitches affecting the user experience after getting multiple feedback from the end users’ the DevOps team will analyze the feedbacks given by end users and they will reach out to the developer team tries to rectify the mistakes they are performed in that piece of code by this we can reduce the errors or bugs that which we are currently developing and can produce much more effective results for the end users also we reduce any unnecessary steps to deploy the application. Continuous Feedback can increase the performance of the application and reduce bugs in the code making it smooth for end users to use the application.

### 7. Continuous Operations

We will sustain the higher application uptime by implementing continuous operation, which will assist us to cut down on the maintenance downtime that will negatively impact end users’ experiences. More output, lower manufacturing costs, and better quality control are benefits of continuous operations.

# DevOps Advantages and Disadvantages

Here are some advantages and disadvantages that DevOps can have for business, such as:

### Advantages

- DevOps is an excellent approach for quick development and deployment of applications.
- It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.
- DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
- DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.
- It improves customer experience and satisfaction.
- DevOps simplifies collaboration and places all tools in the cloud for customers to access.
- DevOps means collective responsibility, which leads to better team engagement and productivity.

### Disadvantages

- DevOps professional or expert's developers are less available.
- Developing with DevOps is so expensive.
- Adopting new DevOps technology into the industries is hard to manage in short time.
- Lack of DevOps knowledge can be a problem in the continuous integration of automation projects.

# `8 DevOps Best Practices To Follow`

Developing software is a very tedious process. In a traditional company setup, the software development process is undertaken by two main teams i.e. the development team and the IT operations team. As expected, having two separate teams that work on a single project can cause internal frictions between the teams and hence slow down the overall deployment process, leading to delayed software release and reduced profits.

![logo8](public\static\images\blogs\testing\devops-the-secret-weapon-of-speedy-developers\logo8.png)

### 1. Have a Centralized Unit For DevOps

In large organizations, a centralized unit is often used for DevOps. This centralized unit is responsible for creating DevOps tools like Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Puppet, etc. This unit has ownership of all the DevOps tools that are developed and uses agile for each of the teams involved.

Among all the different **[DevOps tools](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-popular-devops-tools/)** available, the centralized DevOps team is responsible for choosing the ones that are most relevant, beneficial, and important for the organization. This unit maintains these tools and provides guidance for developers to implement the processes involved.

### 2. Shift Left With CI/CD

The most important process of DevOps is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). In short, CI / CD processes enable software companies to develop and deliver software in very short cycles.

**What does CI actually mean?**

CI or Continuous Integration is a continuous process in which any code changes that are from different contributors are integrated into the Central Repository. This allows developers to continuously merge any of the code changes at any time.

**Why is this process important?**

- It is always easier to find out if there are any errors or issues when the code size is smaller, compared to finding any defects in a large code.
- It allows you to use some automated tools to detect if the code in the system is correct or not.
- It allows faster deployment of processes.

**What is CD?**

CD or Continuous Delivery is a process that begins after Continuous Integration (CI). All the codes that are from CI are taken for production. This is a very important process for shifting the left. The CD process begins by developing, building, and testing the CI. The CD process is not as much adopted and implemented as the CI process but is crucial for a wholesome DevOps integration.

**Why is Continuous Delivery (CD) Important?**

- It makes the process of developing software almost painless.
- It makes the overall process low in risk.
- Deployment of large and complex applications is made simpler.
- All the activities become predictable.
- Software development can be done on-demand.

Both **[Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ci-cd/)** are essential to make the life cycle  of software development

### 3. Always Take A ‘Security First Approach’

In today’s world, security is very important, especially for software that can be hacked and breached. So it becomes mandatory that all the processes are constantly monitored in real-time to detect the presence of security issues.

Using a security-first approach will help **[detect any security threat](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-security-system-should-evolve-to-handle-cyber-security-threats-and-vulnerabilities/)** and risk earlier so that a lot of consequences of delayed action can be prevented with low cost and loss of data. This also increases security.

### 4. Use the Right Tools

For a DevOps approach to be successful, the processes have to be automated. In order to effectively automate software development processes, DevOps tools are absolutely necessary.

There are so many DevOps tools available for different purposes, such as measuring different metrics, detecting security issues, etc. In order to save time and shorten the life cycle of software development, it is mandatory to use the right kind of tool.

**Here are some of the DevOps tools that you could use:**

- Middleware is a Multi-cloud orchestration and management platform that helps DevOps deploy, manage and scale applications across any cloud infrastructure with just a click of a button.
- Jira and Bugzilla help view the progress of the development and collaborate with other teams effectively.

### 5. Monitor the Right Metrics

In order to have DevOps be integrated into the organization effectively, it is important to monitor the right kind of metrics. These metrics are the ones that give information on the effectiveness of DevOps. The metric can range in different categories such as lead time, the severity of the issue, the average time it takes to detect an issue, and so on.

There are so many metrics and one can get confused with all the data presented. The most important thing to determine is the metrics that are important for achieving your organization’s goal and focusing on monitoring only them.

### 6. Switch To Microservices

Any work that is split into its smaller counterparts is much easier to finish than a single large chunk of work. The same principle is used in DevOps to make work easier using microservice architecture.

The traditional method of working involves combining all the smaller counterparts into a single program which is harder to work with. The microservice architecture involves deploying all the smaller applications and services independently.

### 7. Decide Which Processes And Tests To Automate First

Automating all processes in the software development life cycle is the ultimate goal for DevOps. It can be rather daunting to automate all processes at once. So an effective way of automating processes is to determine which is the most essential step for software development.

Some important steps in software development that you can automate first include compiling codes, User Interface (UI) testing, functional testing, etc., based on the goal that you are trying to achieve. Automate processes that are most important and most frequently used before moving on to processes that are less important or less frequently used.

### 8. Build Only Once But Implement Continuous Deployment

Building the source code a couple of times, again and again, takes a lot of time that could be saved to make the process shorter. Software need to be built, packed, and bundled before they are deployed. Building the software in a clean environment will minimize the errors from being created and hence shorten the development cycle.

DevOps involves releasing software frequently in order to lessen the overall burden. In order to do so, the software must first be in a finished state and be tested in an environment that is similar to that of a production stage. It is impossible to test the software in a real production stage though. That’s why a deployment stage has to be introduced.

### Conclusion

DevOps is not just a trend. It is a way of approach that can make a huge difference in the way your organization develops and releases software. To recap, here are some of the most important steps to implement DevOps effectively in your organization:

- Have all the DevOps tools been developed, maintained, and used from a central unit?
- Implement CI / CD processes to shorten the software development cycle
- Create a security-first approach to all your DevOps processes
- Use the right kind of tools for achieving the goals of your organization
- Only monitor the metrics that are important for an effective DevOps integration
- Use microservice architecture to deploy small applications frequently than use monolithic architecture to deploy large, complex applications
- Automate the processes one by one focusing on the most important ones at first
- Build the software only once but implement a continuous deployment process
